# Web Design
Made with plain HTML5 and CSS3.
## Summary
I tried to to do these projects as the instructions said, "functionally similar".
That said, the projects are not nice to the eye but do pass all the tests and they are more than functional.
While not visually pleasing(Looking at you Portfolio), I assure you I spent some quality time, finding myself learning all over again some important HTML and CSS properties.
If you ever happen to stumble upon these projects, please take a look at my code but don't plagiarize the whole thing as per freeCodeCamp's Terms of Use.
I won't probably be redesigning these any time soon.

Thanks for reading.
